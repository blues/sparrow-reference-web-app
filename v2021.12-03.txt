    Explicitly clear FactoryResetID in Notecard before test. (#2733)
    
    This change fixes an issue whereby if a Notecard has a non-zero
    FactoryResetID due to a prior card.restore,connected:true, it would
    cause the TestArrayEnvVars to fail because the "provisioned" environment
    variables would be erased by Notehub upon reception of the non-zero
    FactoryResetID.
    
    Further, the notecard's FactoryResetID is not erased by
    card.restore,delete:true, and there is no obvious user feedback in the
    test artifacts that the notecard has a non-zero FactoryResetID, so the
    cause of the test failure was not obvious.
    
    Issuing a card.restore,reset:true sets the FactoryResetID to "" to
    prevent the Notehub from re-provisioning the Notecard and erasing any
    environment variables.  This command is only used if the test is not
    specifically exercising card.restore,connected:true.  This is tested by
    the TestCardHubRestore test.

    test: Add tests for account recovery (#2725)
    
    Also known as 'forgot password'. This confirms that we're able to
    recover an account via the Kratos flow. It currently focuses on the
    happy path, as we're probably going to rework the flow down the road.
